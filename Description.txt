Requirements:
- Create a way to restart the game (replay button or your choice) when the Gigapet dies - he should get full health, and come back to life (find your own graphic for this button)
- Create a view that only loads when the app first starts that allows you to pick between two characters (use the attached graphical resources for that). - Whatever character picked is the one that is used in the game until the app is closed and re-opened
- Create a 3rd item that the Gigapet needs randomly - obedience - find your own graphic for this item
- Based on which character is selected change the scenery to match that character (pick your own graphics from the attached graphical resources)
