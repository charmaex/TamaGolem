# TamaGolem
Tamagotchi like game with a golem!

Similar to MiniRPG I didn't spend much time to create this game.
It has a very simple game logic. The character needs love or food and you feed him by dragging the corresponding symbol onto him.
Right now you can choose between two characters but more characters can be added easily. (Actually there is a third character - the miner - whose graphics need to be adjusted to make it fully work)
You can pick the character at startup and when your pet died.
This game uses UIKit to do some animations.
